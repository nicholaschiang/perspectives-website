                <h2 class="milestone">1917</h2>
                <p>The conflict has been going on since the early 1900s, when the mostly-Arab, mostly-Muslim region was part of the Ottoman Empire and, starting in 1917, a &apos;mandate&apos; run by the British Empire. Hundreds of thousands of Jews were moving into the area, as part of a movement called Zionism among mostly European Jews to escape persecution and establish their own state in their ancestral homeland. (Later, large numbers of Middle Eastern Jews also moved to Israel, either to escape anti-Semitic violence or because they were forcibly expelled.) Communal violence between Jews and Arabs in British Palestine began spiraling out of control.</p>

                <p>The Hussein-McMahon correspondence between Sharif Hussein of Mecca, governor of the Hijaz province of Arabia, and Sir Henry McMahon, the British high commissioner to Egypt, represents one of the most controversial aspects of British involvement in the Middle East. In a series of eight letters written between 14 July 1915 and 30 January 1916, the two men negotiated the terms under which Hussein would encourage the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and enter World War I on the side of the Allies. In particular, Hussein demanded British recognition of the independence of the Arab areas of the Ottoman Empire now known as Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, and Saudi Arabia.</p>

                <p>[O]n May 16, 1916, the , officially known as the Asia Minor Agreement, laid down the borders of the Middle East as we have known them for a century. The diplomats, Francois Georges-Picot for France and Sir Mark Sykes for Britain, had worked out the details in five months of negotiations, from November 1915 to March 1916.</p>
                <p> The agreement was marked out on a map with grease pencil in a series of straight lines, most likely to create &apos;uncomplicated borders.&apos; The agreement divided the land that had been under Ottoman rule since the early 16th century into new countries in two spheres of influence: Iraq, Transjordan and Palestine under British control; and Syria and Lebanon under French control.</p>

                <p>During the conflict [WWI], the Ottoman Empire sided with the Central Powers against the Allies. Seeing an opportunity to liberate Arab lands from Turkish oppression, and trusting the honor of British officials who promised their support for a unified kingdom for the Arab lands, Sharif Hussein bin Ali, Emir of Mecca and King of the Arabs (and great grandfather of King Hussein), launched the Great Arab Revolt... In June 1916, as head of the Arab nationalists and in alliance with Britain and France, Sharif Hussein initiated the Great Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule. His sons, the emirs Abdullah and Faisal, led the Arab forces, with Emir Faisal&#x2019;s forces liberating Damascus from Ottoman rule in 1918. At the end of the war, Arab forces controlled all of modern Jordan, most of the Arabian peninsula and much of southern Syria.</p>

                <p>World War I radically changed the political geography of the Middle East. The Ottoman Empire had long been the &apos;Sick Man of Europe,&apos; hemorrhaging territory for nearly a century. It lost control of its European possessions prior to the war and, having allied with the defeated Central Powers, lost its Middle Eastern territories afterward. The victorious Allies transformed the Middle East into its current form, with its European-designed names, flags, and borders...</p>
                <p> Ottoman provinces became Arab kingdoms, while Christian and Jewish enclaves were carved out in Lebanon and Palestine...</p>
                <p> [T]he borders of the new states were determined neither by topography nor demography. The infamous , the secret Franco-British-Russian pact that allocated regional zones of control, became the blueprint.</p>

                <h2 class="milestone">1919</h2>
                <p>The first official U.S. foray into the politics of the post-Ottoman Middle East came about as the result of a suggestion made by President Woodrow Wilson to the Council of Four entente powers (France, Great Britain, the United States, and Italy) assembled in Paris to determine the terms of peace. In an attempt to resolve an acrimonious dispute between Britain and France over the future disposition of the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire, Wilson suggested the formation of an interallied commission on Syria. The commission would travel to the Middle East &apos;to elucidate the state of opinion and the soil to be worked on by any mandatory. They should be asked to come back and tell the Conference what they found with regard to these matters...&apos; </p>
                <p> Although both France and Britain acquiesced to the idea of the commission, neither power appointed delegates to participate in its activities. As a result, the commission became a U.S. commission and thus has been commonly referred to by the names of its two commissioners, , president of Oberlin College in Ohio, and Chicago businessman and Democratic Party activist . King and Crane traveled to Palestine, Syria Lebanon, and Anatolia in the summer of 1919 to meet with local representatives. Their findings, filed with the U.S. delegation at Paris, were subsequently ignored by the peace negotiators.</p>

                <p>The League of Nations divided the territory [formerly under Ottoman rule] into new entities, called mandates. The mandates would be administered like trusts by the British and French, under supervision of the League, until such time as the inhabitants were believed by League members to be ready for independence and self-government... </p>
                <p> The mandate territories were Syria and Lebanon, awarded to France; Iraq, awarded to Britain; and a new entity called Palestine, which was also placed under British control.</p>

                <p>The Nazi assumption of power in 1933 triggered a massive refugee crisis as German Jews sought to find safe haven from persecution. Between 1933 and 1936, more Jews emigrated from Germany to Palestine than to anywhere else in the world. Around 154,300 Jews (including 34,700 from Germany) had entered Palestine legally and thousands more illegally, increasing the percentage of Jews in the Palestinian population from nearly 17 percent in 1931 to almost 30 percent in 1935.</p>

                <p> The Holocaust took place in the broader context of World War II. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Over the next year, Nazi Germany and its allies conquered much of Europe.</p>
                <p> In a period marked by intense fighting on both the eastern and western fronts of World War II [1942-1945], Nazi Germany also intensified its pursuit of the &apos;Final Solution.&apos; These years saw systematic deportations of millions of Jews to increasingly efficient killing centers using poison gas...</p>
                <p> By May 1945, the Germans and their collaborators had murdered six million European Jews as part of a systematic plan of genocide&#x2014;the Holocaust. When Allied troops entered the concentration camps, they discovered piles of corpses, bones, and human ashes&#x2014;testimony to Nazi mass murder. Soldiers also found thousands of survivors&#x2014;Jews and non-Jews&#x2014;suffering from starvation and disease.</p>

                <p>In 1936, the Palestinian resistance to foreign rule and to foreign colonization broke out into a major rebellion that lasted virtually until the outbreak of the Second World War...</p>
                <p> In April 1936, what started as minor Arab-Jewish clashes quickly flared into a widespread revolt. A new union of Palestinian political parties was formed, the Arab Higher Committee, headed by the Mufti of Jerusalem, Al Hajj Amin al-Husseini. The Committee called for a general strike to support the demand for national government. Despite strong Palestinian resistance to Jewish immigration, the British Government issued permits for several thousand new immigrants, offering further provocation to Palestinian nationalists...</p>
                <p> As the strike prolonged, violence increased. There were attacks on British troops and police posts as well as on Jewish settlements, sabotage of roads, railways, pipelines and so on...</p>
                <p> During earlier Palestinian Arab uprisings, Jewish settlers often had restrained retaliation under the doctrine of the Havlaga, or restraint. But now, not unexpectedly, there were Jewish reprisals...</p>

The British Government announced the appointment of a to investigate the causes of the &apos;disturbances&apos; and turned to the rulers of other Arab States for the mediation that eventually led to the calling off of the strike in October 1936. The official count of casualties was 275 dead and 1,112 wounded, but the Royal Commission&apos;s estimate was 1,000 deaths.</p>
                <p> The end of the strike was to prove a lull in the rebellion. The issue of the Royal Commission&apos;s report brought an almost immediate renewal of violence, starting with the assassination of a British District Commissioner. Although it was not conclusively established that the assassins were Arab, the High Commissioner declared the Arab Higher Committee proscribed, arresting its prominent leaders and deporting them to the Seychelles Islands, while the Mufti of Jerusalem was able to escape to Lebanon, from where he continued to direct the rebellion.</p>

Despite Hitler&apos;s response, al-Husayni still collaborated with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in several ways. He broadcast anti-Allied and anti-Jewish propaganda by radio to the Arab world and to Muslim communities under German control or influence. He sought to inspire and to indoctrinate Muslim men to serve in Axis military and auxiliary units. Even after he realized that the Germans would not give him what he sought and intended to use his Muslim recruits without regard to his advice, al-Husayni continued to work with both Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany until 1945.</p>

                <p>In 1947, Great Britain, unable to reconcile its conflicting obligations to both Jews and Arabs, requested that the United Nations take up the question of Palestine. In May, the U.N. Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) was created by a General Assembly resolution. UNSCOP&apos;s purpose was to investigate the situation in Palestine and &#x2018;submit such proposals as it may consider appropriate for the solution of the problem of Palestine.&apos;</p>
                <p> At the time, the U.N. consisted of 55 members, including Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. Palestine by then remained the only one of the formerly Mandated Territories not to become an independent state. No representatives from any Arab nations, however, were included in UNSCOP. Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia requested that &apos;The termination of the Mandate over Palestine and the declaration of its independence&apos; be placed on the agenda, but this motion was rejected. The Arab Higher Committee thus announced it would not collaborate, although individual Arab states did agree to meet with representatives from UNSCOP&#x2026;</p>
                <p> Two proposals emerged: a federal State plan and a partition plan. The latter passed by a vote of seven to three with one abstention, the dissenting votes being cast by India, Iran, and Yugoslavia, who all favored the federal state plan.</p>
                <p> On September 3, UNSCOP submitted its report to the U.N. General Assembly. The report noted that the population of Palestine at the end of 1946 was estimated to be almost 1,846,000, with 1,203,000 Arabs (65 percent) and 608,000 Jews (33 percent).</p>

Jerusalem, cherished by both Muslims and Jews as a holy city, was to become an international enclave under U.N. trusteeship. </p>
                <p> The Zionists, then led by David Ben-Gurion, accepted this partition plan, even though they had always dreamed of controlling all of western Palestine and Jerusalem. The Palestinian Arabs and the surrounding Arab states rejected the partition proposal. They felt that Palestine was all theirs, that the Jews were a foreign implant foisted upon them, and that they had the strength to drive them out.</p>

                <p>The Palestinian refugee problem originated as a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, when five Arab armies invaded the State of Israel just hours after it was established. During the ensuing war, as many as 700,000 Palestinian Arabs fled their homes in the newly created state. Many of the Palestinian Arabs who fled did so voluntarily to avoid the ongoing war or at the urging of Arab leaders who promised that all who left would return after a quick Arab victory over the new Jewish state. Other Palestinians were forced to flee by individuals or groups fighting for Israel. </p>
                <p> Of the Palestinians who left, one-third went to the West Bank (which was under Jordan&#x2019;s control), one-third went to the Gaza Strip (under Egypt&#x2019;s control), and the remainder to Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The Arab nations refused to absorb these Palestinians into their population and they were instead settled into refugee camps. Only Jordan&#x2019;s King Abdullah agreed to confer citizenship on the 200,000 Palestinian living in Jordan and the Jordan-controlled West Bank and East Jerusalem. In 1949, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) was created to oversee the economic integration of the refugees into these Arab countries.</p>

                <p> The most grinding and visible expressions of animosity were border clashes. Most of the tension along the frontiers resulted from Arab infiltration.

                <p>In the early 1950s, Egypt violated the terms of the Egyptian-Israeli armistice agreement and blocked Israeli ships from passing through the Suez Canal, a major international waterway. It also began to block traffic through the Straits of Tiran, a narrow passage of water linking the Israeli port of Eilat to the Red Sea. This action effectively cut off the port of Eilat -- Israel&apos;s sole outlet to the Red Sea and Indian Ocean&#x2026; At the same time, Palestinian Arab fedayeen launched cross-border infiltrations and attacks on Israeli civilian centers and military outposts from Egypt, Jordan and Syria.

By the end of the day, the crisis abated when the Security Council adopted Resolution 340, which called for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of all forces to their October 22 positions, and U.N. observers and peacekeepers to monitor the ceasefire.

This plan upheld the goals of the Camp David Accords regarding autonomy for the Palestinians of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and disapproved of Israel&apos;s establishment of any new settlements in these areas. It further proposed that at the end of a transitional period, the best form of government for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip would be self-government by the resident Palestinian population in association with Jordan. Under the plan, Israel would be obliged to withdraw from the occupied territories in exchange for peace, and the city of Jerusalem would remain undivided; its final status would be decided through negotiations. The plan rejected the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Although Labor leader Peres expressed support for the plan, Prime Minister Menachem Begin and the Likud opposed it, as did the PLO and the Arab states. The plan was subsequently shelved. </p>

                <p> In mid-January the intifada broke out in the heart of Arab Jerusalem itself, as Israeli security forces used tear gas around the two especially sacred mosques in the Haram al-Sharif, trying to disperse Palestinian demonstrators.

                <p> The Intifada ended in a stalemate, with the Palestinians unable to eject the Israelis from the territories and the Israelis unable to stop the violence. That made the occupation increasingly uncomfortable. As a result, both sides soon fundamentally revised their policies: Within months the P.L.O. agreed to recognize and make peace with Israel, and to establish a self-governing entity in a small part of Palestine. And Israel, some months later, agreed to recognize the P.L.O. and to evacuate much if not most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. </p>
                <p> In addition, the United States was to recognize the P.L.O. and reopen its dialogue with it, and Jordan finally severed all administrative links with the West Bank.

[Israeli Minister of Defense Ehud] Barak and [Interim Israeli Prime Minister Ehud] Olmert have made clear that their objective is not to wipe out Hamas, but instead to force the radical group to accept a durable cease-fire on Israel&apos;s terms. While they hope to weaken Hamas, Israel&apos;s leaders are aware that a military campaign is unlikely to destroy the organization that remains the most popular political force in Gaza. Any attempt to do so would require not only a massive invasion of all of Gaza, but also an open-ended reoccupation of a hostile population, a trap Olmert and Barak want to avoid at all costs.</p>

                <p>The rival Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas have signed a landmark reconciliation pact aimed at ending their bitter four-year rift. </p>
                <p> A ceremony marking the deal, which was mediated by Egypt, took place on Wednesday [May 4, 2011] at the Egyptian intelligence headquarters in Cairo... </p>
                <p> The pact provides for the creation of a joint caretaker Palestinian government before national elections next year&#x2026; </p>
                <p> The deal calls for the formation of an interim government to run the occupied West Bank, where Abbas is based, and Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and prepare for parliamentary and presidential elections within a year. </p>
                <p> Palestinians see this reconciliation as crucial for their drive to establish an independent state in the territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war.</p>

                <p>In a May 19, 2011 speech at the US State Department, President Obama pressed Israel, in unusually frank terms, to reach a final peace agreement with the Palestinians, citing the boundaries in place on the eve of the June 1967 Arab-Israeli War as the starting point for negotiation about borders. </p>
                <p> The formulation goes beyond principles outlined by President George W. Bush, who stated during his first term that &apos;it is unrealistic to expect&apos; Israel to pull back to the 1967 boundaries, which were based on cease-fire lines established in 1949. Obama said the negotiations about final borders, which he indicated may include land swaps to accommodate Israel&#x2019;s large settlement blocs, should result in &apos;a viable Palestine, a secure Israel.&apos;</p>
                <p> The president said a &apos;full and phased withdrawal of Israeli military forces&apos; from the West Bank should be carried out in coordination with Palestinian security forces. He described a future Palestinian state as &apos;nonmilitarized,&apos; a key Israeli demand.</p>

                <p>Palestine became the 195th full member of Unesco on Monday, as the United Nations organization defied a mandated cutoff of American funds under federal legislation from the 1990s. The vote of Unesco&apos;s full membership was 107 to 14, with 52 abstentions. </p>
                <p> The step will cost the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization one-quarter of its yearly budget &#x2014; the 22 percent contributed by the United States (about $70 million) plus another 3 percent contributed by Israel. Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, said that American contributions to Unesco, including $60 million scheduled for this month, would not be paid. </p>
                <p> Cheers filled the hall at Unesco&apos;s headquarters here after the vote, with one delegate shouting, &apos;Long live Palestine!&apos; in French. The Palestinian foreign minister, Riad al-Malki, praised the organization, saying that &apos;this vote will help erase a tiny part of the injustice done to the Palestinian people&apos; and that it would help protect world heritage sites in Israeli-occupied territory. In a long speech, Mr. Malki said that &apos;this membership will be the best step toward peace and stability,&apos; insisting that the Palestinian request for membership in Unesco was &apos;linked in no way to our request to join the United Nations.&apos;</p>

                <p>The Palestinian bid for statehood at the United Nations was effectively stalled Friday after the Security Council approved a report stating its inability &apos;to make a unanimous recommendation.&apos; </p>
                <p> &apos;We knew from the beginning ... that we might not be able to succeed in the Security Council because there is a powerful country that has the veto power,&apos; said Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian envoy to the United Nations. He said that he believed the report was &apos;objective.&apos; The United States has been vocal about its intention to veto any Palestinian bid for statehood. Last week, France and the United Kingdom said they would abstain from the vote. Those three nations, along with China and Russia, have veto power in the Security Council... </p>
                <p> Were a council resolution to pass, the membership bid would be forwarded to the General Assembly, where passage is all but assured. A vote in the near term does not seem likely. But should it take place, diplomats say that the Palestinians are unlikely to get even the nine votes necessary for a resolution to pass, because of a large number of abstentions. The U.S. veto would effectively be moot... </p>
                <p> The next step for the Palestinians remains unclear. They could sidestep the Security Council and go straight to the General Assembly, where they would get an upgraded observer status, matching that of the Vatican, but not full membership. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, however, has said that they will not pursue that option.</p>

                <p>Israel launched its military offensive against Gaza on 14 November, marking the latest eruption in a conflict with Palestinian militants which has raged between the two sides for years. The latest violence has left dozens of people dead, many of them civilians, and shows no sign of ending soon. </p>
                <p> Israel&apos;s offensive on Gaza began with an air strike that killed the commander of Hamas&apos;s military wing, Ahmed Jabari, whom it accused of responsibility for &apos;all terrorist activities against Israel from Gaza&apos; over the past decade. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) subsequently announced the start of Operation Pillar of Defense, which it said was intended to protect Israeli civilians from rockets and mortars fired by militants in Gaza, as well as cripple Hamas&apos;s capability to launch attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation was launched because he could no longer &apos;accept a situation in which Israeli citizens are threatened by the terror of rockets&#x2026;&apos; Although Jabari&apos;s killing signaled the start of Israel&apos;s offensive, it was preceded by spates of deadly cross-border violence which saw Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas&apos;s Qassam Brigades, firing hundreds of rockets into southern Israel and the Israeli military shelling Gaza and carrying out air strikes&#x2026; Mr. Netanyahu has insisted that he is not seeking to topple Hamas. </p>
                <p> On 18 November, the prime minister announced that the IDF had attacked more than 1,350 &apos;terrorist targets&apos; and had achieved &apos;significant hits on weapons aimed at Israeli citizens, as well as on those who use the weapons and those who dispatch them.&apos; Israel has said it is doing its utmost to avoid civilian casualties, although more than half of those killed in Gaza have been women and children, according to Hamas officials. The Israeli government has approved the calling up of 75,000 army reservists in apparent preparation for a ground offensive. Some 31,000 have already been summoned&#x2026; </p>
                <p> Since the conflict began, 1128 rockets have been fired towards Israel, the IDF says, with 324 intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. Before the recent offensive, Israel had repeatedly carried out air strikes on Gaza as Palestinian militants fired rockets across the border. But the aerial and naval bombardment is its most intense assault on the territory since Israel launched a full-scale invasion four years ago. Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007, a year after winning a decisive victory in general elections. Israel withdrew from the strip in 2005 but maintains a blockade around it. Israel, as well as the United States and the European Union, regards Hamas as a terrorist organization.</p>

It will be the first time that the two have held direct talks since 2010. Clearing the last obstacle to resuming peace talks, the Israeli cabinet voted Sunday to approve the release of 104 Palestinian prisoners, an unpopular move with many Israelis.

                <p> The goal of the negotiations will be to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel with agreed-upon borders and security arrangements. Officials said that talks are initially expected to focus on procedural issues, like the location, schedule and format of negotiating sessions, before moving on to tackle the core issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Israeli side will be represented by Israel&apos;s justice minister, Tzipi Livni, and Isaac Molho, Mr. Netanyahu&apos;s special envoy. On the Palestinian side will be Saeb Erekat, the chief negotiator, and Mohammed Shtayyeh, a close adviser to Mr. Abbas. The Monday evening session will be a working dinner at the State Department, hosted by Mr. Kerry, who has made an intensive effort to revive the moribund talks. The Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams are to meet again on Tuesday before heading home. The next round of talks would be held in the Middle East. Martin Indyk, the former United States ambassador to Israel, whom Mr. Kerry is expected to name on Monday to manage the talks for the United States, would attend that round.</p>

                <p>The United States on Wednesday [Sep. 14, 2016] signed an unprecedented new security agreement with Israel that will give the Israeli military $38 billion over 10 years. </p>
                <p> The deal, the largest such agreement the U.S. has ever had with any country, amounts to $3.8 billion a year beginning in budget year 2019, compared with $3.1 billion the U.S. gave Israel annually under the current 10-year deal that expires in 2018. </p>
                <p> Under the agreement, Israel&apos;s ability to spend part of the funds on Israeli military products will be phased out and eventually all of the money must be spent on American military industries. Israel&apos;s preference for spending some internally had been a major sticking point in the deal.</p>

                <p>In an unprecedented diplomatic rebuke of Israel, the United States abstained Friday on a United Nations Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements, allowing the highly charged measure to pass.</p>
                <p> The resolution was approved 14-0 with the one abstention... The measure demands Israel &apos;immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.&apos; It declares the establishment of settlements by Israel has &apos;no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law&apos;...</p>
                <p> U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power, in remarks to the council after the vote, said the U.S. position on the settlements has remained unchanged for five decades, and quoted a 1982 statement by then-President Ronald Reagan, which declared Washington &apos;will not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlements.&apos;</p>
                <p> &apos;The U.S. has been sending the message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for five decades,&apos; Power said. Settlement activity, she added, &apos;harms the viability of a negotiated two-state outcome and erodes prospects for peace and stability in the region.&apos; At the same time, she said, &apos;Our vote does not in any way diminish our steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel.&apos;</p>

                <p>Israel&apos;s parliament has passed a law that retroactively legalizes almost 4,000 settler homes built unlawfully on private Palestinian land in the West Bank, a move that critics say is a massive blow to any future peace deal.</p>
                <p> The Knesset approved the legislation in a 60-52 vote Monday evening, at a time when Israel has ramped up plans for settlement expansion in the West Bank...</p>
                <p> Settlements are broadly viewed as an obstacle to peace by Palestinians and the international community. The Israeli newspaper describes the measure as a &apos;land-grab bill.&apos; Rights groups have vowed to challenge it at the country&apos;s Supreme Court.</p>
                <p> The vote is another major victory for Israeli hard-liners. According to The Associated Press, Israeli Cabinet Minister Yariv Levin called it &apos;a first step in a series of measures that we must take in order to make our presence in Judea and Samaria present for years, for decades, for ages.&apos;</p>

                <p> This is a sharp shift in Russian policy, which until now has formally held that Jerusalem should eventually be under a permanent international regime&#x2026;</p>

                <p>The Palestinian militant group Hamas has published a new policy document - the first since its founding charter [in 1988].</p>
                <p> It declares for the first time a willingness to accept an interim Palestinian state within pre-1967 boundaries...</p>
                <p> The text is seen as an effort by Hamas, which rules Gaza, to soften its image.</p>
                <p> &apos;The document gives us a chance to connect with the outside world,&apos; spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said...</p>
                <p> The new document, which Hamas says does not replace the charter, accepts the establishment of a Palestinian state within territories occupied by Israel in 1967 as a stage towards the &apos;liberation&apos; of all of historic Palestine west of the River Jordan.</p>
                <p> This is an apparent shift in Hamas&apos;s stated position, which previously rejected any territorial compromise.</p>
                <p> The document says this does not, however, mean Hamas recognises Israel&apos;s right to exist in any part of the land or that it no longer advocates violence against Israel.</p>

                <p>&apos;I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,&apos; President Trump said in a controversial address from the White House on Wednesday afternoon [Dec. 6, 2017]. He also directed the State Department to &apos;begin preparation to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.&apos;</p>
                <p> [Trump&apos;s announcement] is a dramatic shift from decades of American foreign policy that called for the status of the city, which is claimed as a capital city by both Israelis and Palestinians, to be decided in peace talks. The declaration also breaks with long-standing international practices; no nation has an embassy in Jerusalem... </p>
                <p> [P]rominent Palestinian exiled politician, Mohammed Dahlan, said on Twitter that the decision is a &apos;historic mistake&apos; that breaches &apos;the principle of inviolability of the status of Jerusalem&apos;...</p>

                <p>Israel&apos;s parliament has passed [on July 19, 2018] a controversial law characterising the country as principally a Jewish state, fuelling anger among its Arab minority. </p>
                <p> The &apos;nation state&apos; law says Jews have a unique right to national self-determination there and puts Hebrew above Arabic as the official language.</p>
                <p> Arab MPs reacted furiously in parliament, with one waving a black flag and others ripping up the bill. Israel&apos;s prime minister praised the bill&apos;s passage as a &apos;defining moment&apos;... </p>
                <p> Called The Basic Law: Israel as the Nation State of the Jewish People, the legislation essentially defines Israel first and foremost as a Jewish state... </p>
                <p> It also reiterates the status of Jerusalem under Israeli law, which defines the city - part of which is claimed by the Palestinians as the capital of a future state - as the &apos;complete and united... capital of Israel&apos;... </p>
                <p> In one of its clauses, the law stresses the importance of &apos;development of Jewish settlement as a national value&apos;, though it is unclear whether this also alludes to settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank...</p>
                <p> The bill has been under discussion since it was first introduced in 2011 and has undergone multiple amendments&#x2026; Israel has no constitution but instead passed over time a series of Basic Laws which have constitutional status. The nation state law is the 14th such basic law.</p>

                <p>US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday [Nov. 18, 2019] announced a major reversal of the US&apos; longstanding policy on Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, rejecting a 1978 State Department legal opinion that deemed the settlements &apos;inconsistent with international law.&apos;</p>
                <p> &#x2026;&apos;After carefully studying all sides of the legal debate... the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not, per se, inconsistent with international law,&apos; Pompeo said, citing President Ronald Reagan&apos;s 1981 assessment that the settlements were not &apos;inherently illegal.&apos;</p>
                <p> Pompeo said the US government is &apos;expressing no view on the legal status of any individual settlement&apos; or &apos;addressing or prejudging the ultimate status of the West Bank.&apos;</p>
                <p> He said the conclusion was &apos;based on the unique facts, history and circumstances presented by the establishment of civilian settlements in the West Bank.&apos;</p>
                <p> The new US position was swiftly repudiated by the European Union, with diplomats noting President Donald Trump&apos;s desire to woo evangelical voters and privately saying the move reflects a US willingness to &apos;give the finger&apos; to international law.</p>
